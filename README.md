# zircons_recognition

This project contains PYTHON codes for the following paper. Please consider citing the paper if you find it of any help.
1. Please start with main file: "main.py", training models and predicting zircons types of JH zircons and Tibet zircons.
2. All other (function) files in "models.py" for SVM,WSVM,TSVM and RF are called in the function train().
3. Other figures in the paper shall be easy to reproduce with the provided function file "plot_fun.py".
4. Models include SVM,WSVM,TSVM and RF. TSVM is selected as our working model for its best performance.
